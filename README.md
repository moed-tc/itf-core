Overview
The MOED-TC framework models space-time as a locally elastic structure. This compression is governed by two pillars:
 * Contraction Tensor (TC): A mixed (1,1) tensor in a 4D internal gauge fiber describing the elastic deformation of coordinates.
 * Inertia of Time (IT): A scalar potential that resists extreme compression and misalignment of internal temporal coordinates.
Key Features
 * Singularity Prevention: Avoids Black Holes and Big Bangs via a natural "bounce" mechanism (repulsion) when the IT potential grows exponentially under compression.
 * Particle Mechanism: Generates masses and quantum-like behaviors from small harmonic oscillations of space-time.
 * Emergent Dark Matter: Gravitational effects generated by anisotropic residuals (eigenvalue dispersion) of the TC.
 * Emergent Dark Energy: Effects generated by isotropic residuals of volumetric compression and the IT potential.
Relation to MOND
MOED-TC can be interpreted as a relativistic analog of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).
 * MOND modifies gravity in low-acceleration regimes to explain galaxy rotation curves.
 * MOED-TC introduces effective modifications directly into General Relativity through local geometric compressibility.
 * The framework is fully covariant and addresses cosmology, gravitational lensing, and singularities.
Contraction Tensor (TC)
The TC is defined as the mixed tensor T^j{}_i in the 4D internal fiber (diagonal prototype):
Derived physical quantities:
 * Quadratic Compression Strength: \mathrm{Tr}(T^2) = f_1^2 + f_2^2 + f_3^2 + f_4^2
 * Compression Volume Factor: \det(T) = f_1 f_2 f_3 f_4
Inertia of Time (IT)
The potential resisting extreme compression:
The strong growth of this potential at high compression prevents singularities and enforces the bounce effect.
Effective 4D Projection
The internal compression projects onto the base space-time as an effective contribution to the stress-energy tensor (simplified isotropic part):

Current Status
This is an early-stage theoretical exploration. The goal is to share core ideas, gather feedback, and iteratively develop the formalism and numerical tests.
