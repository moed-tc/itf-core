## Abstract

The Inertia of Time Framework (ITF) extends general relativity by introducing a three-component internal temporal vector \(\tau^a\) with restoring inertia and a mixed deformation tensor \(C^a_b\). We show that the non-linear potential induced by temporal misalignment (\(\kappa_1\)) and temporal compression (\(\kappa_2\)) generates effective potential wells and discrete energy states. In the low-energy, non-relativistic limit, this dynamics recovers an equation formally analogous to the Schrödinger equation, where the wave function emerges as a collective field from the temporal vector. The effective Planck constant \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) and particle masses arise dynamically from the temporal sector, without being fundamental constants. The model predicts non-monotonic quantum coherence in mesoscopic interference experiments, offering falsifiable deviations from standard decoherence theories.

## 1. Mechanism for Emergent Quantization

The core physical mechanism is the **temporal misalignment** and **compression**:

- Desalinhamentos nas componentes \(\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3\) são penalizados pelo termo  
  \(\kappa_1 \sum_{i<j} (\tau_i - \tau_j)^2\)  
  → favorece alinhamento e introduz energia de restauração.

- Alta compressão temporal (\(I_t = \tau^a \tau_a\) grande) é penalizada por  
  \(\kappa_2 (I_t)^2\)  
  → cria poços quarticos de potencial efetivo → estados discretos de energia.

Esses termos geram osciladores harmônicos efetivos em torno do vácuo, mimetizando a quantização sem postular \(\hbar\) fundamental.

## 2. Effective Equation of Motion

From the action term \(S_{It} = \int \sqrt{-g}\, I_t(\tau^a)\), the field equation for \(\tau_i\) is:

$$
\nabla_\mu \left( \sqrt{-g} \nabla^\mu \tau_i \right) = \frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i}
$$

In the non-relativistic, weak-field limit:

$$
\partial_t^2 \tau_i - c_t^2 \nabla^2 \tau_i + \frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i} = 0
$$

With \(I_t = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \sum_{i<j} (\tau_i - \tau_j)^2 + \kappa_2 (I_t)^2\), the potential derivative becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i} = 2\kappa_1 \sum_{j \neq i} (\tau_i - \tau_j) + 4\kappa_2 I_t \tau_i
$$

This is a non-linear wave equation with effective mass and quartic self-interaction.

## 3. Emergence of the Schrödinger Equation

Define the collective wave function as the complex field:

$$
\psi = e^{i \phi}, \quad \phi = \int \tau^\alpha \, dx_\alpha
$$

Assume a modulated plane wave form:

$$
\tau^a = \psi \, e^{-i m_\mathrm{eff} t / \hbar_\mathrm{eff}}
$$

Substituting into the non-relativistic equation and linearizing around small amplitude (mean-field approximation), we recover:

$$
i \hbar_\mathrm{eff} \partial_t \psi = \left[ -\frac{\hbar_\mathrm{eff}^2}{2 m_\mathrm{eff}} \nabla^2 + V_\mathrm{It}(|\psi|^2) \right] \psi
$$

Where:
- \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) emerges from the temporal scale: \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff} \sim \sqrt{\kappa_1 / \beta}\)
- \(V_\mathrm{It}(|\psi|^2)\) is the effective potential from the quartic term \(\kappa_2 (|\psi|^2)^2\) and misalignment contributions
- \(m_\mathrm{eff}\) is the inertial mass generated by temporal compression

**Key insight**: Quantum mechanics emerges dynamically from the temporal vector field and its inertia — \(\hbar\) is state-dependent and not fundamental.

## 4. Emergent Particle Masses

Small oscillations around the vacuum \(\langle I_t \rangle = 3\) (or zero) yield harmonic modes:

$$
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{quad} \sim \frac{1}{2} (\partial \delta\tau^a)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 (\delta\tau^a)^2, \quad \omega \sim \sqrt{\kappa_1, \kappa_2}
$$

Quantization gives energy levels \(E_n = \hbar \omega (n + 1/2)\). Identifying these as effective mass terms:

$$
m_\mathrm{eff} \sim \frac{\hbar \omega}{c^2}
$$

provides a geometric origin for particle masses from temporal fluctuations, without a Higgs-like mechanism.

## 5. Non-Monotonic Quantum Coherence (Falsifiable Prediction)

The effective decoherence rate is:

$$
\mu_t = m \, I_t + \kappa \, \mathrm{Tr}(C^2) + \lambda R
$$

Visibility of interference:

$$
\mathcal{V}(m) \sim \exp\left[-\frac{\mu_t}{\hbar_\mathrm{eff}}\right]
$$

**Prediction**: \(\mathcal{V}(m)\) is **non-monotonic** in certain regimes (when \(\partial I_t / \partial m \approx 0\) and second derivative negative) → reentrant coherence islands at high masses.

**Experimental target**:
- Talbot-Lau interferometry with objects 10⁹–10¹¹ amu
- Controlled variation of density/confinement
- Search for discrete windows of high visibility

Failure to detect non-monotonicity under these conditions would refute the model in the proposed regime.

## 6. Summary

Quantum mechanics emerges as forced harmonic oscillation of the temporal vector field in a space-time with temporal inertia. The effective Planck constant \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) is dynamical, state-dependent, and the theory predicts non-monotonic coherence at mesoscopic scales — a clear, falsifiable signature distinct from standard models.  

The derivation remains qualitative and phenomenological; full UV completion and stability remain open questions.
