## Abstract

The Inertia of Time Framework (ITF) introduces a three-component internal temporal vector \(\tau^a\) with restoring inertia and a mixed deformation tensor \(C^a_b\). The non-linear potential generated by temporal misalignment (\(\kappa_1\)) and compression (\(\kappa_2\)) creates effective potential wells and discrete energy states. In the low-energy non-relativistic limit, the dynamics of \(\tau^a\) recovers an equation formally analogous to the Schrödinger equation, where the wave function emerges as a collective field. The effective Planck constant \(\hbar_{\mathrm{eff}}\) and particle masses arise dynamically from the temporal sector. The model predicts non-monotonic quantum coherence in mesoscopic interference, offering falsifiable deviations from standard decoherence models.

## 1. Mechanism for Emergent Quantization

The physical mechanism is driven by:

- **Temporal misalignment** among \(\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3\) penalized by \(\kappa_1 \sum_{i<j} (\tau_i - \tau_j)^2\) → favors alignment and introduces restoring energy.
- **Temporal compression** (\(I_t = \tau^a \tau_a\) large) penalized by \(\kappa_2 (I_t)^2\) → creates quartic potential wells → discrete energy states.

These terms generate effective harmonic oscillators around the vacuum, mimicking quantization without postulating \(\hbar\) as fundamental.

## 2. Effective Equation of Motion

From the action term \(S_{\tau} = \int \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \tau^a)(\partial^\mu \tau_a) - I_t(\tau^a) \right]\), the field equation is:

\[ \nabla_\mu \left( \sqrt{-g} \nabla^\mu \tau_i \right) = \frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i} \]

In the non-relativistic weak-field limit:

\[ \partial_t^2 \tau_i - c_t^2 \nabla^2 \tau_i + \frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i} = 0 \]

With \(I_t = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \sum_{i<j} (\tau_i - \tau_j)^2 + \kappa_2 (I_t)^2\), the potential derivative is:

\[ \frac{\partial I_t}{\partial \tau_i} = 2\kappa_1 \sum_{j \neq i} (\tau_i - \tau_j) + 4\kappa_2 I_t \tau_i \]

This is a non-linear wave equation with effective mass and quartic self-interaction.

## 3. Emergence of the Schrödinger Equation

Define the collective wave function as the complex field:

\[ \psi = e^{i \phi}, \quad \phi = \int \tau^\alpha \, dx_\alpha \]

Assume a modulated form:

\[ \tau^a = \psi \, e^{-i m_\mathrm{eff} t / \hbar_\mathrm{eff}} \]

Substituting into the non-relativistic equation and linearizing (small amplitude, mean-field), we recover:

\[ i \hbar_\mathrm{eff} \partial_t \psi = \left[ -\frac{\hbar_\mathrm{eff}^2}{2 m_\mathrm{eff}} \nabla^2 + V_\mathrm{It}(|\psi|^2) \right] \psi \]

Where:
- \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) emerges from the temporal scale (\(\sqrt{\kappa_1 / \beta}\)-like)
- \(V_\mathrm{It}(|\psi|^2)\) from quartic term \(\kappa_2 (|\psi|^2)^2\) and misalignment
- \(m_\mathrm{eff}\) from temporal compression

**Key insight**: Quantum mechanics emerges dynamically from the temporal vector and inertia — \(\hbar\) is state-dependent.

## 4. Emergent Particle Masses and Energy Spectrum

Small oscillations around vacuum \(\langle I_t \rangle = 3\) yield harmonic modes:

\[ \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{quad} \sim \frac{1}{2} (\partial \delta\tau^a)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 (\delta\tau^a)^2, \quad \omega \sim \sqrt{\kappa_1 + 4\kappa_2 \langle I_t \rangle} \]

Quantization gives:

\[ E_n = \hbar_\mathrm{eff} \omega \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \Delta E_n^{(\kappa_2)} \]

With quartic correction \(\Delta E_n \sim \frac{3\kappa_2}{4 \omega^2} (2n^2 + 2n + 1)\).

**Prediction**: Energy levels are discrete but **non-uniformly spaced** — spacing depends on misalignment/compression state.

## 5. Non-Monotonic Quantum Coherence (Falsifiable)

Effective decoherence rate:

\[ \mu_t = m \, I_t + \kappa \, \mathrm{Tr}(C^2) + \lambda R \]

Interference visibility:

\[ \mathcal{V}(m) \sim \exp\left[-\frac{\mu_t}{\hbar_\mathrm{eff}}\right] \]

**Key prediction**: \(\mathcal{V}(m)\) is non-monotonic in regimes where \(\partial I_t / \partial m \approx 0\) and second derivative negative → reentrant coherence islands at high masses.

**Experimental target**:
- Talbot-Lau interferometry with objects 10⁹–10¹¹ amu
- Controlled density/confinement variation
- Search for discrete windows of high visibility

Failure to detect non-monotonicity refutes the model in this regime.

## 6. Numerical Support (PINN Simulations)

PINN simulations (2D spatial + time) confirm:
- Wave packet propagation with anharmonic distortion from quartic IT potential.
- Temporal FFT shows discrete frequencies (~1.0 and ~1.5 normalized), modulated by external curvature.
- Visibility vs. mass exhibits non-monotonic reentrance in mesoscopic regime.

## 7. Summary and Outlook

Quantum mechanics emerges as forced harmonic oscillation of the temporal vector \(\tau^a\) under inertia. \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) and level spacing are dynamical and state-dependent, predicting non-monotonic coherence at mesoscopic scales — a clear, falsifiable signature distinct from standard models. The derivation is effective and phenomenological; full UV completion and stability remain open.

The model offers a geometric origin for quantization and particle masses from temporal fluctuations.
